# Broken Links Fix Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to fix broken external links in the educational resources section of the application.

## Changes Made
1. Created a backup of the original external resources file:
   - Original file: `src/data/externalResources-new.ts`
   - Backup file: `src/data/externalResources-new.backup.ts`

2. Updated the external resources file to remove broken links, including:
   - YouTube videos that were unavailable/private/removed
   - PDF files that returned 404 errors
   - External websites with errors

3. The following types of links were removed:
   - CorbettMaths PDF resources with 404 errors
   - YouTube embedded videos that were unavailable
   - SaveMyExams URLs with errors
   - GeoGebra and other external URLs with errors

## Sources Affected
The majority of broken links came from the following sources:
- YouTube videos (multiple educational channels)
- CorbettMaths PDFs (`corbettmaths.com/wp-content/uploads/...`)
- Dr. Austin Maths resources (`draustinmaths.com/...`)
- SaveMyExams resources (`savemyexams.com/...`)

## Implementation Details
Instead of directly editing the original file, we:
1. Created a new file with fixed content
2. Backed up the original file
3. Replaced the original file with the fixed version

This approach ensures that if there are any issues, we can easily revert to the original implementation.

## Next Steps
It's recommended to:
1. Test the application to ensure the removed links don't cause any UI issues
2. Consider finding replacement resources for the removed content
3. Set up a regular link checker to identify broken links proactively
